		<p>Come and join us, we are a small, friendly group that welcomes anyone with a passion for history. 
		Individuals, couples, and families are all welcome and are well represented. If you wish to develop a 
		craft skill or require help to create an authentic display, we can also support you to do this.
		</br></br>
		Membership is just fifteen pounds for a year and we give discounts for families. If you wish to attend 
		our next event and are not a member then contact thevicus@outlook.com and we will help make 
		arrangements for you. Your first event is always free so you shouldn't worry about paying.
		</br></br>
		You must be over 18 to join the Vicus, unless you are part of a family that are also full and active 
		members. We are a family friendly group, but children are not allowed to attend an event on their own 
		without parents present and taking part in the event.
		</br></br>
		Everyone is required to join the society to take part in its events. The fee goes towards paying our 
		insurance premium and fuel allowance for members who attend events. (currently 15p/mile).
		</br></br>
		Current membership rates are:</p>
		<ul>
		<li>Full adult annual membership - &pound15
		</br>(18+; No children under 16 allowed unless parent or guardian actively present - hence those under 
		18 can be included within a family membership)</li>
		<li>Temporary membership - &pound5
		</br>(covers a single continuous event)</li>
		<li>Family membership - &pound30
		</br>(Two adults and children; A family includes all members of a single related family group, which 
		may include 'children' over 16, that generally resides together)</li>
		<li>Single parent family membership - &pound15
		</br>(A family includes all members of a single related family group, which may include 'children' 
		over 16, that generally resides together)</li>
		<li>Dogs and other animals - Free
		</br>(must be insured and injected)</li>
		</ul>
		<p>There is always the option of temporary membership (if you really do not want to join full time). 
		</br>
		Non-members, however, do not receive any event payment, as members do, and cannot access the 
		forum.
		</br></br>
		During the winter we also hold a couple of private training sessions for our members involving both
		combat training, exchange of craft skills, and the group's AGM

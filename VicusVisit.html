					case 'Brocca':
						document.getElementById("bio").innerHTML = "Brocca means 'badger' in Old Welsh and is a member of the Icenii tribe. She is a trader and, whilst not a fan of the Roman occupation or Romans in general, realises that she has to make a living somehow. The forts offer a good potential source of income as she can no longer maintain the family farm on her own. Brocca is determined to maintain her tribal identity, especially as her husband and sons were killed in earlier uprising and battles against the Romans. So, if the oppourtunity for a revenge attack presents, She will happily take up arms to fight even if it is hopeless, to show the pride of the tribe in the face of oppression. </br></br>Brocca works with bone and antler, carving buttons, toggles, and other artefacts, making candles from tallow and beeswax (using linen thread wicks), weaves braids and belts, and puts her cooking skills to good use. Her clothes are made from wool and linen, with sewn woolen socks inside the leather shoes when the weather is colder. Her bedding is a linen mattress stuffed with fleece and wool offcuts, and she inherited the traditional tools from one of her late sons, while her shield, spear, bow, and arrows came from her late husband. None of her family had armour as they were not in the cheiftain class, being cattle farmers, but she does have a couple of items of jewellery as adornment. She is thinking of starting a bar, which might give her the oppourtunity for making more money in future for less hard work, especially if the soldiers get drunk and their purses can be removed! </br></br>The tools are based on finds in the museum of London. I have a small hand saw, awl, rasps, and chisels, plus a sharpening stone.";

					case 'Clodia':
						document.getElementById("bio").innerHTML = "Since a vicus is a trading settlement that develops next to a Roman fort, I thought it would be appropriate to be a trader. I am a Roman woman, Clodia Felix, and I run a shop called <i>Brittaniae Domi Tabernae</i> (a rather tongue in cheek 'British Home Stores'). I sell everything you would need to furnish your home in the Roman style. </br></br>Roman homes were different to those of native Iron Age Britons. They lived in round houses made of wattle and daub, cob, or stone, with thatched or turved roofs. Roman houses, by contrast, were generally rectangular and varied both in size and the number of rooms according to the wealth and occupation of the owner. A typical trader's dwelling in a vicus would comprise one or more rooms for living, with a workshop or shop fronting onto the street. Other locals may also have had Roman style homes: a successful farmer may have owned a small villa, a retired soldier may own a house in a local town. These Roman style homes would be furnished with Roman objects, which I supply. </br></br>I stock all sorts of lighting, from oil lamps to candle holders; glassware; ceramics; linens and cushions. These may be produced locally or imported from the wider Roman world. I can also arrange for your home to have mosaic floors and wall paintings - even your own portrait - by linking you to local craftspeople and artisans. All of the objects I supply are authentic to our period, for example these candle holders were specifically made for me and are based on a pair of 1st century candle holders found at Caerleon, south Wales.";

					case 'Artist':
						document.getElementById("bio").innerHTML = "Our artist has travelled a long way to be here. They studied at the academy in Alexandria, one of the cultural centres of the Classical World, and is now taking advantage of the new markets opening up in the recently subjugated province of Britannia.</br></br>Our knowledge of the painting techniques used in this period are limited. What we do know is that their art had its roots firmly based in the Classical Greek and Hellenistic tradition of realism, many painters in the Roman period were Greek or of Greek origin.</br></br>The most high-ranking artists were those that painted on wooden panels. These panels were framed and hung on the wall, just as paintings are today. Few examples of their work survive, there are written descriptions and copies in mosaic and on wall paintings, but only in Egypt, with its arid environment, do we find actual examples that give us a glimpse of this lost artistic tradition.</br></br>Portrait painting was common throughout the empire, found in domestic as well as commercial settings; a portrait of the emperor could be found in the local tavern as well as a government building, the forum, or temple. Portraits were commissioned at important times in peoples' lives, such as graduation, marriage, or promotion, just as we have photos taken to commemorate a special occasion today.</br></br>The painter would make their own paints, the colours were created from either natural minerals (e.g. red ochre) or artificially (e.g. Egyptian blue). There were a wide range of colours to choose from, but wealth and status would be reflected in the colours selected. Some, such as the vibrant red Vermillion, created from the mineral Cinnabar, was almost as expensive as gold.</br></br>The nearest the ancient world had to modern oil paints, that allowed the seamless blending of colours, was the encaustic medium which incorporated wax. The technique has been lost, but analytical study has thrown light on its composition, enabling experimental work to take place. The examples here are based on portraits found in the Fayum district of Egypt, and mosaics and wall paintings from Pompeii.</br></br>The easels and picture frames are based on an image of an artist's studio painted on the inside of a sarcophagus from Kerch, modern Ukraine. The paint pots and tools are replicas of artists equipment found near Fontenay-le-Comte, France, and Nida-Heddernheim, Frankfurt.";

					case 'Auxiliary':
						document.getElementById("bio").innerHTML = "Not everyone fighting with the Roman army was a Legionary. You had to be a citizen of Rome to join the legions. If your nation was allied to the empire, you might join as an auxiliary.</br></br>Auxiliaries were often recruited from nations that had specific skills. The Baleric island supplied slingers, the Hamians (in modern Syria) provided archers. Others provided cavalry or infantry.</br></br>Auxiliary soldiers were paid about two-thirds of what a Legionary was paid. They served for 25 or 26 years and at the end, were awarded Roman citizenship. There seems to have been a policy of not using people in their own countries, probably to prevent conflicts of loyalties.</br></br>Our auxiliary is coming to the end of his service. He was recruited in Gaul and served with the 9th Legion since he was sent to Britain. He wears a mixture of Roman and Gaulish clothing. He has caligae on his feet with socks. He's wearing long trousers and a Roman tunic under his mail. Around the neck you can see a torc, a reminder of his origins. He wears a mail shirt (Lorica Hamata) with two layers of mail on the shoulder. He has a ballets, a belt with straps dangling at the front. These serve no protective function, they are just a fashion. The belt has a pugio on the left. This is a short dagger, probably better as a tool than a military weapon. He carries a spata sword on the right side. The bronze helmet is not capable of stopping a direct blow from a sword or axe, but will deflect a blow that would have left a nasty scalp wound. His main defence is the large Danum shield. This was found at Doncaster, the original is in the museum there. He carries a short fighting spear as his preferred weapon.</br></br>Our auxiliary wears a paenula cloak. This is semi-circular and has a long hood.";

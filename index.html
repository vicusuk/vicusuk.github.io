		<p><b>Salve,</b> and welcome to The Vicus, a small independant family re-enactment group with twenty years' 
		experience of entertaining and informing the public.
		</br></br>
		A vicus was a trading settlement that grew around a Roman fort or fortress. Populated by both Romans and Iron Age 
		Britons, it provides an ideal backdrop for us to potray life in 1st and early 2nd century AD Britain. This was an 
		exciting period of British history, a time of change where cultures clashed and merged.
		</br></br>
		Our interpretations provide an immersive and engaging experience based on archaeological research. This allows us 
		to depict life in a vicus as authentically as possible, in a way that is both fun and accessible to all our 
		visitors.
		</br></br>
		</p>
		<ul style="text-align:left;">
			<li><b>See</b> Roman soldiers as they visit the vicus to spend their hard-earned wages, relax, or watch gladitorial 
		combat.</li>
		</br></br>
			<li><b>Hear</b> traders as they sell their wares from both Britain and the wider Roman world.</li>
		</br></br>
			<li><b>Smell</b> the scent of woodsmoke and cooking from the open hearths, or incense drifting up from the household 
		and temple shrines.</li>
		</br></br>
			<li><b>Watch</b> craftspeople as they create the objects and posessions that mattered so much to the people of early 
		Romanised Britain.</li>
